               voltage is held at +3.3v (Vcc) and when it is LOW, it
               is pulled down to ground. */

                          "low" by accepting current flow to ground
                          and "high" by providing increased
                          impedance. An example use would be to
                          connect a pin to a bus line (which is pulled
                          up to a positive voltage by a separate
                          supply through a large resistor). When the
                          pin is high, not much current flows through
                          to ground and the line stays at positive
                          voltage; when the pin is low, the bus
                          "drains" to ground with a small amount of
                          current constantly flowing through the large
                          resistor from the external supply. In this
                          mode, no current is ever actually sourced
                          from the pin. */

              it is closer to 3.3v (Vcc) the pin status is high, and
              when it is closer to 0v (ground) it is low. If no
              external circuit is pulling the pin voltage to high or
              low, it will tend to randomly oscillate and be very
              sensitive to noise (e.g., a breath of air across the pin
              might cause the state to flip). */

                     the same way as with INPUT, but the pin voltage
                     is gently "pulled up" towards +3.3v. This means
                     the state will be high unless an external device
                     is specifically pulling the pin down to ground,
                     in which case the "gentle" pull-up will not

                       is gently "pulled down" towards 0v. This means
                       the state will be low unless an external device
                       is specifically pulling the pin up to 3.3v, in
